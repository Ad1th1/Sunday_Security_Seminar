The first talk of the ‘Sunday-Security-Seminars’ was given by Aman Priyanshu, an undergraduate researcher at MIT, Manipal. His topics of interest are anomaly detection, federated learning, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy (DP-SGD, PATEs, Eps-DP), social network anonymization, neural network memorization and identification of privacy leakage in LLMs or visual models. He is a recipient of the MITACS research and one of eleven undergraduate students to be selected for the AAAI Undergraduate Consortium from across the world. 

There were atleast 27 attendees in all, from student clubs such as RSM, Cryptonite and MOSS.

Aman started by telling us about how his journey began. He told us about how he started off in cybersecurity by solving CTF’s and cryptography. While reading up on cryptography, he came across learnable encryption systems that sparked an interest in the same. He was also simultaneously doing a deep-dive in AI. He explained some common jargon in AI, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, Naive Bayes algorithm, clustering algorithms, etc.

The resources he used to learn the same were youtube videos and the specialization by Andrew NG on Coursera on deep learning. He then explained jargon like privacy-preservation learning models, federated learning, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. He explained how research in federated learning had boomed in 2018 and how it has continued to be an amazing field of research, thereby encouraging attendees to do the same. He also spoke about his experience at AAAI and the opportunities for collaboration it presented, motivating us to apply for undergraduate consortiums. 

All in all, it was a wonderful session that introduced and broke down jargon about privacy-preservation in AI in a friendly environment. 

The questions asked during the session were as follows:

1. What is web exploitation and binary exploitation
1. Where to learn AI from? (youtube videos and the course by Andrew NG on deep learning)
1. What happens when we lose data from one mobile, while speaking about federated learning
1. What is polarity of data?
1. Where is differential privacy used? (medical application)
1. How do you get knowledge in both disciplines to start research? 
1. How to read a research paper?  (start with abstract, go through methodology and conclusion  and then read the paper OR go from abstract, intro and previous methodologies and then read the literature 
1. How to start research? 
1. What are some research opportunities? (MITACS, DAAD, Max Planck Institute. Write a good essay for MITACS and DAAD, have a good CGPA for DAAD) 
1. How did I find relevant research papers for a beginner as there are too many and confusion about which one to read?  (-> Q1 journals always and relevant conferences, read review papers)
1. For a beginner who wishes to get into ML, how much time do you suggest someone should spend on getting good at data analytics: numpy pandas and the like or can they start with the Andrew ng courses straightaway? (suggested to learn basics in a week and go on to the course)
